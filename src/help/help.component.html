      <p>
        This simple application is a partial proof-of-concept of a Progressive Web Application (PWA)
        for ABC Racing Company. Using service workers speeds up loading time, and supports off-line operation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This application uses Firebase, a well-known Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) system.
        Firebase provides hosting, authentication, S3-like storage, and database-in-the-cloud services.
        Its architecture supports completely real-time data updates.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application uses Angular.
        To access Firebase, we use the wrapper known as AngularFire.
        The service worker support and other PWA support uses the relevant Angular PWA capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        This application does not at present support server-side rendering.
        Server-side rendering is less important as a means of speeding up load time
        than it might otherwise be due to the use of Service Workers.
        However, the basic logic for SSR is present, and in fact simply
        running the relevant npm scripts, and then deploying the contents of the
        <tt>dist/server</tt> directory to a web server ought to work properly.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).


The deployment of the SSR version to Firebase hosting requires special gymnastics and is not implemented.
The contents of `dist/server` should be deployable to any web server and function correctly,
but this has not been tested.

## Accessibility

Accessibility is not implemented fully in this version of the app.
A more complete implementation would implement keyboard navigation as provided for in the CDK `a11y` library.
In addition, items should be assigned "roles" and `aria-*` attributes.

Bits and pieces of work-in-progress may be found in `app/sidenav`.

## Miscellaneous

1. The locked-version of `@angular-devkit/schematics` in `package.json` is to deal with a bug in `ng new pwa`. See https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/issues/11663 for more information.
