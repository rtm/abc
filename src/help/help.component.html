      <p>
        This simple application is a partial proof-of-concept of a Progressive Web Application (PWA)
        for ABC Racing Company. Using service workers speeds up loading time, and supports off-line operation.
      </p>

      <p>
        This application uses Firebase, a well-known Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) system.
        Firebase provides hosting, authentication, S3-like storage, and database-in-the-cloud services.
        Its architecture supports completely real-time data updates
        as well as offline behavior for the database.
        We have not yet implemented security rules for the database and storage.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application uses Angular.
        To access Firebase, we use the wrapper known as AngularFire.
        The service worker support and other PWA support uses the relevant Angular PWA capabilities.
      </p>

      <p>
        The UI toolkit used is Angular Material.
        Together with `@angular/flex-layout`, this provides us with much of the responnsiveness in the app.
      </p>

      <p>
        This application does not at present support server-side rendering.
        Server-side rendering is less important as a means of speeding up load time
        than it might otherwise be due to the use of Service Workers.
        However, the basic logic for SSR is present, and in fact simply
        running the relevant npm scripts, and then deploying the contents of the
        <span style="font-family: monospace; ">dist/server</span> directory to a web server ought to work properly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The assets used by the app are taken from Firebase Firestore and Storage.
        At the moment, there is neither any way to upload data,
        nor any way for the user to enter it.
        Test data and fixtures must be entered or uploaded directly in the Firebase console.
      </p>

      <p>
        The application is not yet fully optimized in terms of speed.
        The design calls for different sizes of graphic assets to be available,
        but automatic transcoding is not yet implemented.
      </p>

      <p>
        Features which are still missing include (1) bookmarking and (2) display of information about events.
      </p>

      <p>
        Unit tests and e2e tests are not yet implemented.
        They will be implemented with relative ease using Angular's testing frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        Accessibility is not implemented fully in this version of the app.
        A more complete implementation would implement keyboard navigation as provided for in the CDK `a11y` library.
        In addition, items should be assigned "roles" and `aria-*` attributes.
        Bits and pieces of work-in-progress may be found in `app/sidenav`.
